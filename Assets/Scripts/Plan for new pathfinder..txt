Rules: No walls bisecting obstacles. No start or finish points inside of obstacles.

As walls are set up, a a list of wall cells is maintained. Train works it's way along the walls, keeping track of the current wall. Always turn in one direction, and if it ends up back at it's start point, all cells passed constitute an obstacle. Start point doesn't really matter.Remember that diagonals aren't considered continuous wall.

Entities:
- (done) The total number of wall cells.
-A scanning train, with length determined by the fidelity of the map. Corner-appraisals are conducted from the middle cell of the train. To deal with cases of wall endings, when the train turns around, a single cell can be both a head and a caboose.
-The number of wall cells encountered by the train.
-Ever cell must have five additional states: one for each kind of corner and one to designate it as part of an obstical.
-Overy obstacle should be its own object, refenced by every one of its constituent cells. This should store references to its extreme points at every compass point.

Things we're looking for:
Corners: places where the only adjacent non-train square is perpendicular to the direction of travel.
Obtacles: Loops of wall without any breaks.
